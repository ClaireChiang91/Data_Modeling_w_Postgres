# Data Modeling with Postgres
## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
Therefore, the work includes creating a database schema and ETL pipelines for analyses. 

## Data Model
<img src="https://github.com/ClaireChiang91/Data_Modeling_w_Postgres/blob/main/data_model.png" width="1000">

Fact table: songplays
Dimension tables: users, artists, time, and songs
The ETL process includes processing json metadata files, and insert the data into database.

## Files in repository
* data folder: it includes song datasets and log dada sets. 
  For song data sets, each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that   song.
  For log datasets, it consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the     songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified       configurations.
* test.ipynb: this Jupyter notebook contains SQL queries to test if the tables are correctly created and data are correctly inserted into the table.
* create_tables.py: this is to drop and create tables. 
* etl.ipynb: this Jupyter notebook reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables. 
* etl.py: the work of this scripts are reading and processing files from song_data and log_data. Then it will load data into your tables.
* sql_queries.py: SQL queries this contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
